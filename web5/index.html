    <h3> A personal value I would like to share with the world </h3>
</br>
    <p>
        My hope is for the next generation of people to be able to read my journal and understand that I fought my entire career to become who I am today. I value a world where regardless of color or sexuality everyone has the same chance. My goal is to break down barriers keeping people of color and women out of tech.

    <p> The money I was making as a security professional/ Account manager was... shall we say.. <b>REDICULOUS</b> but I was still very unhappy</p>
    <p> I found my calling during covid when I personally was able to help out my community by provided 35 laptops to students at Mcclain and Central free of charge. I realized my talents were needed elswhere.</p>
    <h3><strong> In my career I have been:</strong> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>successful</li>
        <li>homeless</li>
        <li>discriminated> against</li>
        <li>arrested for doing my job</li>
        <li>Revered by colleagues</li>

        <li>Designing a Non-Profit to provide Cyber Security Services to minority ownend businesses</li>
    </ul>
