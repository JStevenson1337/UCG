    <h1>My Personal Journey</h1>

    <hr />
    <h3>A personal value I would like to share with the world</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      My hope is for the next generation of people to be able to read my journal
      andunderstand that I fought my entire career to become who I am today. I
      value a world where regardless of color or sexuality everyone has the same
      chance. My goal is to break down barriers keeping people of color and
      women out of tech.

      The money I was making as a security professional/ Account manager was...
      shall we say.. <strong>RIDICULOUS</strong> but I was still miserable as cliche as it sounds. Money cannot buy happiness
    </p>
    <p>
      I found my calling during covid when I personally was able to help out my
      community by provided 35 laptops from parts provided by doners, former clients and well wishers to students at Mcclain and Central free
      of charge. When my wife at the time(who is a teacher) I realized my talents were needed elswhere.
